## LSTM-RNN :brain: vs ARIMA :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

>This repository documents the development of a LSTM-RNN and ARIMA model in MATLAB.  
Hyperparameters of the LSTM are adjusted to avoid over-fitting and under-fitting.
The 'Adam' optimisation algorithm is adopted to improve LSTM-RNN performance.

Time series of available peak monthly discharge at station 28074 Kegworth, River Soar.
There are 84 observations missing between 07/02/1984 to 01/03/1991:
